            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Francysk Skaryna life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1470</strong> Skaryna was born in 1470</li>
               
                
                <li>
                    <strong>1504</strong> - The year 1490 is often proposed based on the 
                    assumption that he was 14 when he came to study in Kraków. The date is an upper boundary;
                     while new students younger than 14 were rare, older ones were not unusual, 
                     and Skaryna could have started his studies at the age of 18 or even older. 
                     Mikalai Shchakatsikhin  suggested that the overlapping sun and moon on Skaryna's 
                     personal emblem indicates that he was born around the time of the 1486 solar eclipse, 
                     which was observed in Polotsk.
                </li>
               
               
                <li>
                    <strong>1517</strong> Skaryna arrived in Prague
                </li>
                <li><strong>On 6 August 1517</strong> - his first edition, "The Psalter" , was released.  
                    "The Psalter" comprises nearly all of the biblical books of Holy Scripture.</li>
               
               
                
                <li><strong>1520</strong> Skaryna became involved in combating an epidemic of a deadly disease in Prague.
                     The epidemic subsided later that year, but civil unrest broke out in the autumn in Bohemia.
                      Skaryna left the country and moved to Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</li>

                      <li><strong>1532</strong> he worked as a doctor and secretary to John, Bishop in Vilnius. 
                        After two years, creditors of his late brother Ivan considered Skaryna as the brother's primary heir, and put him into Poznań jail. 
                        He was there for several months. Roman Skaryna, Ivan's son and Francysk's nephew, actively helped his uncle, meeting with King Sigismund I.
                         When Skaryna was released, he sent a complaint letter with a counterclaim against the creditors to the King. 
                         In response to the complaint letter, he was awarded two royal privilege certificates (dated 21 November and 25 November 1532). 
                         Those certificates exempted him from the jurisdiction of all authorities except the King.</li>
